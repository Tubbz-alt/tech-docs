**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Easy    
**Screws:** 4 total - 4 x M2 perimeter (black)

### Steps to replace the bottom cover:

1. Align the corners of the bottom cover with the corners of the chassis.
2. Set the bottom cover along the edges and confirm the bottom cover is seated.
3. Replace the 4 perimeter screws.

## Replacing the RAM:

RAM acts as temporary storage for your computer. More RAM generally provides better performance. If you're purchased new RAM, need to replace your RAM, or are re-seating your RAM, follow these steps.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 15 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Medium

### Steps to replace the RAM:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Press the small tabs on both sides of the RAM simultaneously. The RAM should spring up at an angle.

4. Insert the new RAM (or re-seat the existing RAM) by placing it in the keyed slot and pressing down on the RAM until it clicks into place.

## Replacing an M.2/NVMe SSD:

M.2 SSDs offer, at minimum, SATA III speeds and performance in a package about the size of a stick of gum. NVMe M.2 SSDs offer even higher performance. The Meerkat supports one M.2 drive, size 2280, either M.2 SATA or NVMe M.2 PCIe Generation 3.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 5 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Medium

### Steps to replace the M.2 drive:
